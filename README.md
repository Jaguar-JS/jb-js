# About
  Every good site has an online form to fill out â€” whether for registering, ordering food,  or making payments. Forms can be very large; if you accidentally reload a page, you can lose all the data. A sad story, isn't it? To resolve this, let's create a form that will retain the data, when it closes unexpectedly.
  
# Objectives
  On the history page, each submit card should contain a button with the delete-button class. When users click on this button, delete the card related to the button. Also, don't forget to delete this submission from the local storage, so it won't be shown after reloading.

  When users open two browser tabs with the HTML form and change data in one of them, the data also should be updated in the other tab. Check every 100 ms whether the data in the local storage is changed; if so, update the data in the form.
