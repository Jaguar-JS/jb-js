# To-Do List
JavaScript for Beginners

# About
  Have you ever had the feeling that you're missing something important? If so, to-do lists can be of help. A clear outline of your daily tasks will help you stay composed and mentally focused. In this project, you will create a simple to-do list that can manage your tasks.
  
# Objectives

We need to make our program fetch the to-do list from local storage and display the tasks with their states. Also, we need to make the program update the task list in local storage in the following cases:

1. A task is created.
2. A task is deleted.
3. A task is marked as complete.

We don't need the hardcoded tasks anymore, so you can delete them. When users reload the page, the program should store the tasks.
